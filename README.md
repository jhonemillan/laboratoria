# Description
This app, is built in MEAN Stack and not in MERN stack.

For Frontend was used: Angular 4, Bootstrap 3.7, Typescript
For Backend: Node.js, JWT, Mongo, mLab as DB service, and another services to get images

Is completely functional, in Heroku server, but i used a link available purchased before (i purchased this domain in godaddy) for a personal incoming project that i am developing in my freetime.

to access to online site please visit www.reportauncrimen.org


# Technical Description
The app has 3 modules
Auth: uses JWT for manage authorization on routes, bcrypt to encrypt passwords saved in Mongo,login, logout
Comments: where you can post any comment you want, you only will able to delete your own comments and not others.
images: I think would be nice show how to get access to online api to search images.

# Technical missing behaviour
With a little more time, the Firebase can be used at least to manage comments, or authentication improved maybe with social options like google ot facebook

In comments module, is not possible to post comments with images

In general i did not use React but Angular, and with a little more time maybe i would make some features in that.
